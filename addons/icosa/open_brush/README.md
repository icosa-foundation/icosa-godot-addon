## Open Brush Support Progress

<explain open brush here to godot users>

* There are some global issues with color and contrast that need working on. This may or may not affect you depending on your use case.
* The shaders support two directional lights plus a global ambient light color. We try and automatically select the correct lights from your scene and track their settings in realtime. 
* Fog syncing is not implemented yet but you can manually set the fog parameters for each material if needed.
* No audio reactive support yet.

* Here's a list of all Open Brush's brushes annotated with their current support status in this addon:
